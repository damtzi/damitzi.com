                I started programming my last year of high school and I landed my first "real" job
                during my time at Lancaster University. I worked on the university's official app - the iLancaster mobile app
                and the Lancaster University Portal. This is where I started my journey with React and gained experience
                working with a team in an agile environment.

                I have worked at Secretarium for over 5 years and I was lucky
                to be involved in the development of some of their most innovative
                projects. Everything was built on top of confidential computing,
                meaning we prioritized data security and privacy at every step.
